Hi, I'm Josh, a software engineer.

I specialize in Backend development using **NodeJS** or **Golang**. I also do some frontend work with **ReactJS** when working on full stack projects. You can check out some of these projects [here](/projects).

I have a deep understanding of low level programming from years of hobby game development using **C** and **OpenGL**.

I love to learn new technologies, and I am always looking for the next biggest thing in tech.

If you want to contact me, reach out to me at my [email](mailto:me@joshayres.tech).
