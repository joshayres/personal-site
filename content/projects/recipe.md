I have been cooking quite a lot. When looking up recipes I would always get upset about how much I have to scroll down to get to the actual recipe. Because of this I wrote [justrecipe.net](https://justrecipe.net).

I am by no means a web designer, and quite frankly it's something I should definetly put some time into. That being said the website does work, and is pretty cool to use. I hope you enjoy it!
