A SIR(Susceptible, Infectious or Removed) model is a compartmental model in epidemiology. I am no epidemiologist, however at the start of the pandemic I wrote a very basic simmulaiton of the SIR model in javascript with some nice graphics to go along with it. You can play around with it here. //TODO: Put the sim here

Some improvements I would have for this is more meaningful path finding with more options. By this I mean adding either shared locations that all the dots go to, such as a supermarket or an office. Adding an option for social distancing would also be really cool.

You can look at the code [here](https://github.com/joshayres/sirs) (Just a warning this is some real 4 am code)!
